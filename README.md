# project

We have created a project in which we described how to name the files in order to arrange them. These can be easily processed by the computer and easy to interpret by the human. It is also very helpful to show the file in a logical order when viewed in the file explorer or in a terminal.

This is much helpful when there are multiple files with a similar names and files have slight modifications from one another. 

In a data science project, we usually read files using a script or inside the terminal environment. Therefore, it is critical to use filenames that are both machine friendly and consistent across files with similar or related content.

It is also imperative to organize the entire project, to arrange file structures and folders in a logical manner. This would make the code self documented and also it would be much easier to reproduce the results in future. 

The project would also provide a brief description about the virtual environments. We have created an additional environment other than the base that includes all the necessary packages to be installed for successful replication of the codes and thus the data.
